Project by Anna Yanchenko and Megan Robertson for Statistics 531 - Advanced Stochastic Modeling at Duke University in Spring 2016 with Professor Jeff Miller. 

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for modeling sequential data and have many applications. In this project, we used HMMs to capture the latent elements in music creation. The observed states are the pitch and velocity (volume) of each note in an existing song, while the latent states include elements such as chord progression, harmonics, dynamics and melody. In this paper, we implement three different HMMs trained on classical piano pieces and compare the resulting compositions for each model.
